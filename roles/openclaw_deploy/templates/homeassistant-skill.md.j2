# Home Assistant Skill

Use the managed Home Assistant read-only handler.

## Input Contract

User input is everything after `/{{ openclaw_homeassistant_command_skill_name }}`.

- `state <entity_id>`
- `list [--domain <domain>] [--limit N]`
- `turn_on <entity_id>`
- `turn_off <entity_id>`

## Execution Rules

Always execute exactly one command:

```bash
{{ openclaw_homeassistant_container_skills_dir }}/{{ openclaw_homeassistant_skill_name }}/handler.py <raw-user-input>
```

When no input is provided, return:

`Usage: /{{ openclaw_homeassistant_command_skill_name }} state <entity_id> | /{{ openclaw_homeassistant_command_skill_name }} list [--domain <domain>] [--limit N] | /{{ openclaw_homeassistant_command_skill_name }} turn_on <entity_id> | /{{ openclaw_homeassistant_command_skill_name }} turn_off <entity_id>`

Return the handler output as-is.
