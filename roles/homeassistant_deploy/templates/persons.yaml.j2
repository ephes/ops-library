# Person entities for presence tracking
# This file is deployed but persons should be configured via UI
# Go to Settings → People to set up persons and link their devices

# Example configuration (for reference only - use UI instead):
# person:
#   - name: Alice
#     id: alice
#     device_trackers:
#       - device_tracker.phone_alice
#
#   - name: Bob
#     id: bob
#     device_trackers:
#       - device_tracker.tablet_bob
#
#   - name: Charlie
#     id: charlie
#     device_trackers:
#       - device_tracker.laptop_charlie
#
#   - name: Dana
#     id: dana
#     device_trackers:
#       - device_tracker.phone_dana

# Note: Multiple devices per person can be tracked
# Person is "home" if ANY of their devices are home
