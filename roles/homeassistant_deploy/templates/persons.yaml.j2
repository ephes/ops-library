# Person entities for presence tracking
# This file is deployed but persons should be configured via UI
# Go to Settings → People to set up persons and link their devices

# Example configuration (for reference only - use UI instead):
# person:
#   - name: Jochen
#     id: jochen
#     device_trackers:
#       - device_tracker.iphone_von_jochen
#   
#   - name: Claas
#     id: claas
